/**
 * A design proposal derived from each arch's Kennedy class: the major connector, and the
 * rest seats that class calls for.
 *
 * Connector, per the metal-RPD selection matrix — an A-P strap carries the distal-extension
 * classes, a single palatal strap suffices for the tooth-borne Class III, and the mandible
 * takes a lingual bar unless the anteriors need splinting. Full acrylic follows its own
 * table (see chooseAcrylicConnector).
 *
 * Rests, per the rest-placement rules — adjacent to the space on a bounded span, mesial on a
 * free-end terminal abutment, plus an indirect retainer where the class rotates.
 *
 * Clasps, per the clasp-placement rules — a circlet running away from a bounded space, the
 * RPI's infrabulge I-bar on a free-end canine or premolar, a ring on an isolated molar. The
 * T-bar and Y-bar are never proposed: their indications are the position of the undercut and
 * the shape of the survey line, and the 2D arch records neither. They stay manual picks.
 *
 * All of that is the CAST METAL design. A full-acrylic case is a different prosthesis and
 * gets a different, much simpler proposal: its own connector table, clasps only — no rests,
 * no bars — placed by planAcrylicClasps.
 *
 * Dimensional triggers throughout (floor-of-mouth depth, ridge resorption, tori, rest-seat
 * millimetres) are deliberately not modelled: the 2D arch measures no millimetres, so the
 * primary choice always wins. The alternatives that ARE knowable — a compromised abutment,
 * the size of the span — do switch the choice.
 *
 * Pure: mutates only the teeth map it is handed. No DOM, no annotation-state import.

 *
 * Then mesh on the saddles and a plate on every present tooth, because a major connector
 * can only be placed on teeth that anchor it, and the connector switch and plating sync run
 * in the order the catalog's own pick uses (components.major.switchMajorConnectorInJaws
 * expects the plating to already be there; a lingual bar strips it again afterwards). Rests
 * and clasps land last — nothing else reads them, and a clasp's own proximal plate must
 * outlive the plating sync.
